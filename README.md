# Quadropolis solver

The python script `quadropolis_solver.py` will generate high VP solutions to the Quadropolis board game (and the Public Services expansion).
I highly recommend using [PyPy](https://pypy.org) to run the script, it should be about a factor 4 faster than regular python.
To get started simply run `pypy quadropolis_solver.py`.
By default it will generate solutions of atleast 108 VP that use 5 of the Public Services expansion tiles.
